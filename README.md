# CPSC 508 Research Reproduction

This repository contains the Windows binary for version 1.5.3.1 of the [IBM Comprestimator Utility](https://www14.software.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/comprestimator/home.html), the batch file I used for executing 300 tests of the Comprestimator on an indicated storage system, and the raw outputs of two of my own tests.

Each test folder contains the raw output of the tests in CSV format and the spreadsheets I used for creating the histograms and calculating the skewness of the data for each tested data type.
